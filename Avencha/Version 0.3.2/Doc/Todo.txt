[Urgent]
Ability to spawn objects from event scripts
pointer based FOR loop (I've got it all figured out, its pretty cool)
unseen objects and adjectives (a door that you can't instinctively tell is rigged, this
	will be more necesary when queued events are added, as things like level wiring
	would be dodgy if visible)
A HELP command that lists available verbs (courtesy to Wing for the idea)
A revision of LOOK
A herobrine to remove

[Upcoming]
level time,
autonomity
events will be able to trigger/queue events, for instance allowing for a clock which ticks
  every in game second via a recursive queued event, or a lever which triggers a transversal
  object which opens a door, or... something
A debug command designed to be useful for you as opposed to me
A demo environments section (read the readme)
A more dynamic screen print system that has more complicated replacement queries 
	($sb $ob $in)

[Later]
Actually user friendly design, that tells you why it doesn't work on compile time
Some pretty cool functionalities like relative properties, typical data, world triggers
More hook programming

[Still working out]
Senses for hooks, (and machinery) light, odour, shapes and sound
Stimulus associated with events, so when a door opens you see it open, rather than being fed
	flavour text
Thus making the look command possible as a normal verb
Rangen worlds/Rangen environments 
	(so a way to randomly assign different effects to potion types, like rogue :D)

[Eventually I guess]
AI
Language, visuals (what's the difference between a block of yellow, a yellow triangle and a 
	yellow man walking, and the word "Yellow" written in bubble writing on the wall)
Alphabet and symbol shapes.
A whoooole lot of complicated.
