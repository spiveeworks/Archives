Theorem contrapositive:
  forall A B: Prop,
    (A -> B) -> ~B -> ~A.
Proof.
  intros A B.
  intros a_implies_b.
  unfold not.
  intros refute_b.
  intros suppose_a.
  pose (therefore_b := a_implies_b suppose_a).
  case (refute_b therefore_b).
Qed.




Theorem implication_disjunct:
  forall A B: Prop,
    (A -> B) <-> A \/ ~B.
Proof.
  intros A B.
  unfold iff, not.
  refine (conj _ _).
    intros a_implies_b.
