I wake up, and sit up.
Taking in a deep breath through flaring nostrils, I thought loudly.
Starting today, I am going to meet myself a girlfriend.


I roll over and fall onto my feet, and turn to face the day.






/*~The Girl Next Door ~*/

Before me is a decent sized white house, with roof and front door both coloured blue. There are calm brown shades visible through t-paned windows, and there is a lovely track meandering through the front garden, up to my feet.

>I walk along the path, following the stones literally so as to enjoy myself.

Up close a dull brass door-knob is visible for inspection, a banded pattern engraved around the edge of the curved front-face.

>I knock on the door confidently, standing up straight, before spontaneously looking up to the roof of the house.

A few seconds wait... or maybe twenty, I can't tell.

The door opens, and I am exposed to the lovely "girl next door".

Her brows furrow in a charismatic squint and smile, and she speaks.

	"Hello." 
>	"Hi. I don't think we've met."

there is a pause.

	"Well... no, but I know you!"
>	"Of course you do!"
>	"I just wanted to know your name."
	"Really? That's all? Well, my name is Sadie."

I can't help but smile.

>	"That's not really all, I think I'd like to know you better."
>	"The name was just a start."
	"Well do you want to continue by coming in?" Sadie replied.

Butterflies.

The smile disappears from my face... am I surprised by her offer, or appalled that such a dream of mine was waiting right next door to me all along.

Sadie's expression turns quizzical as I seem to be frowning for a second.

	"Absolutely." I say, pulling myself together with urgency.

Sadie turns away. I walk in behind her and she closes the door behind me.


//First date.
