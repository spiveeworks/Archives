[Version 0.1.4]
Added a DEBUG utility, which at the time checked to see if a certain part of the USE coding 
	was working correctly, but now tells you whether or not there is a spoon.
[Version 0.1.3]
LOOK was redesigned to also record what objects you've seen so that USE requires you to have 
	seen it before you can use it
This allowed for USE to easily find what object id the target of a USE command had, which 
	then meant that USE was able to 'transform' the target.
Open Doors :D
[Version 0.1.2]
LOOK and USE exist, also seperated objects and stencils.
Redesigned LOOK to support stencils, USE is silly, and displays some flavour text when set 
	object combinations are USEd :D
[Version 0.1]
Made stuff exist, inputloop and object variables
LOOK lists objects and their location, being a piece of flavour text
