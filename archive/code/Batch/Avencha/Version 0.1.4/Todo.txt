[Urgent]
Language interpreter, which will deal with sentences grammatically, and use nouns recorded
	by LOOK for extra awesomeness
Ability to delete objects (transforming them to stencil id zero)
Ability to transform subject of the verb (degrade keys)

[Upcoming]
More versatile reactions
Intransitive actions (use open_door)
support for adjectives, (locked door is still a door, coloured doors and keys, one use 
	talcum keys)

[Later]
Actual coded "spaces" instead of the flavoursome location system
Nested stencils, maybe they'll eventually be called types again

[Still working out]
Story line
AI hooks (Player is a programmible object with inputs and outputs)
Senses for hooks, (and machinery) light, odour, shapes and sound
Stimulus associated with events, so when a door opens you see it open, rather than being fed
	flavour text
Fields for objects (is door locked? Is vase shattered? Is key Yellow?)

[Eventually I guess]
AI
Other Autonomity
Language, visuals (whats the difference between a block of yellow, a yellow triangle and a 
	yellow man walking, and the word "Yellow" written in bubble writing on the wall)
Alphabet and symbol shapes.
