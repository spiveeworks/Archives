[Version 0.2]
Now this is satisfaction.
 -Adjectives, yes that's right, you didn't even have to buy the sequel
 -grammatically correct commands (USE, you will be missed)
 -Freaking awesome programmable events
Changes made to starta:
 -removed :usage
 -gave adjective support to :stencil and :object
 -:event was remade to be freaking awesome
 -added :output to break up :event definitions... you can only fit so much awesome on a 
   single line :P
 Compatibility issues as of updating - 95%
Added a readme, because using the changelog for instructions is getting messy with so much
  awesome.
Note, syntax for changing an objects id was coded, but not implemented because I can't find
	any use for it other than breaking things, so it will have to wait until the nested
	stencil, or 'type' system, but for now if you look in the compiled event scripts,
	an objects property is represented by "@a.$b" where a and b are the id values of the
	verb part and the property slot respectively, replacing $b with an @ works for all
	purposes, however there is nothing affecting the property translations, so a locked
	door can only be transmuted into a fragile key, have fun with the chaos :)

	(If you don't understand this paragraph, this knowledge is too powerful for you)

[Version 0.1.4]
Added a DEBUG utility, which at the time checked to see if a certain part of the USE coding 
	was working correctly, but now tells you whether or not there is a spoon.
[Version 0.1.3]
LOOK was redesigned to also record what objects you've seen so that USE requires you to have 
	seen it before you can use it
This allowed for USE to easily find what object id the target of a USE command had, which 
	then meant that USE was able to 'transform' the target.
Open Doors :D
[Version 0.1.2]
LOOK and USE exist, also seperated objects and stencils.
Redesigned LOOK to support stencils, USE is silly, and displays some flavour text when set 
	object combinations are USEd :D
[Version 0.1]
Made stuff exist, inputloop and object variables
LOOK lists objects and their location, being a piece of flavour text
