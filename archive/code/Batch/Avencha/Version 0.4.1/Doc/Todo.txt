[Urgent]
programmable visibility (allowing for basic stimulus)
 -Actually, just proper stimulus will work
A HELP command that lists available verbs (courtesy to Wing for the idea)
Some more development in hooks
Overhaul of Avencha's layout
 (actually already done, just not released with this update)

[Upcoming]
level time,
autonomity
events will be able to trigger/queue events, for instance allowing for a clock which ticks
  every in game second via a recursive queued event, or a lever which triggers a transversal
  object which opens a door, or... something

[Later]
Actually user friendly design, that tells you why it doesn't work on compile time
A debug command designed to be useful for you as opposed to me
A demo environments section (read the readme)
A more dynamic screen print system that has more complicated replacement queries 
	($sb $ob $in)
More maths stuff, so greater than, less than, Boolean logic, multiply

[Still working out]
Senses for hooks, (and machinery) light, odour, shapes and sound
Stimulus associated with events, so when a door opens you see it open, rather than being fed
	flavour text
Thus making the look command possible as a normal verb
Rangen worlds/Rangen environments 
	(so a way to randomly assign different effects to potion types, like rogue :D)

[Eventually I guess]
AI
Language, visuals (what's the difference between a block of yellow, a yellow triangle and a 
	yellow man walking, and the word "Yellow" written in bubble writing on the wall)
Alphabet and symbol shapes.
A whoooole lot of complicated.
